##
#   This is a basic socket server that connects to X clients, where X is passed in at runtime, and then stops accepting incoming connections.
#   It opens up the connection for each client on separate threads, so that it always knows which player it is communicating with,
#   and then sends turn information to the engine. It waits some small amount of time for a turn before assuming that none was sent.
#   It waits indefinitely for the engine to finish processing a turn, so it will never close if the engine crashes.
#   Upon receiving the turn data from the engine, it will ignore any messages sent while the turn was being processed,
#   and send a message back to the player to take their next turn.
#   If a connection is dropped, that player automatically 'forfeits'
#   When the game ends, the server should send a final status to all players and then shut down gracefully.
